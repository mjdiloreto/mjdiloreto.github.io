I'm not a superstar, but I love programming.
I'm far from a designer or architect, but I would like to design complex systems.
I read more than I do, but I'm trying to change that.
I appreciate the beauty and simplicity of Lisp.
Functional programming excites me.
I am constantly recommending music.

I'm always learning _something_, right now it's:

-   Clojure
    -   Working through Norvig's _Principles of AI Programming_ (PAIP)
    -   re-frame/reagent
-   Emacs
    -   blogging with org-mode
    -   developing software with Cider


## About this Blog {#about-this-blog}

I write a lot for myself, and I want to formalize the process with a blog. I hope this effort has these effects:

1.  Make my writing better.
2.  Make the collection of my thoughts in writing easier and more convenient to access.
3.  Motivate me to finish more projects.
