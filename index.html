            <p>The following is a literate program written in emacs-lisp.
Rationale I like to write literate programs using org-babel-tangle. It&rsquo;s an excellent workflow for literate programming which allows me to write an entire project in a single file, then tangle all the source blocks to their own files in the project.
Sometimes though I want to incorporate some external files into the project, and this leads to a problem. The literate programming flow with org-babel is always:</p>

            <p>Your Philosophy It&rsquo;s imperative to live by a set of philosophies. It doesn&rsquo;t much matter which set, as long as it is not the empty set.
This applies to all aspects of life, and software development is no exception. Most people live by intrinsic philosophies, sometimes inconsistent, but you will be better served by your philosophies if you codify them. Spell them out deliberately and evolve them according to your experience and others'.</p>

            <p>The fatal flaw in deism is thus not rational at all, but emotional. Pure reason is unappealing because it is bloodless. Ceremonies stripped of sacred mystery lose their emotional force, because celebrants need to defer to a higher power in order to consummate their instinct for tribal loyalty. In times of danger and tragedy especially, unreasoning ceremony is everything. There is no substitute for surrender to an infallible and benevolent being, the commitment called salvation.</p>

            <p>After working with React applications for almost 5 years, I have a certain morbid attraction to the idea that React - along with all other SPA libraries, development, and progress - is unnecessary.
Obviously React exists in a very complex ecosystem. To write the React applications the right way requires:
 javascript transpilers/bundlers hundreds of npm libraries, (potentially) SSR, SSG frameworks and tools  I can&rsquo;t help but feel that the vast majority of web apps that use React do not actually need it.</p>

            <p>Word Salad   Rationale Back in early 2019, when the &ldquo;gibberish challenge&rdquo; was bubbling up through the nascent &ldquo;TikTok&rdquo; milieu, I was compelled to discover an algorithm which, given arbitrary English input, could produce a &ldquo;gibberish&rdquo; phrase appropriate for the challenge.
I searched the web for such an algorithm, since surely someone had to have done this previously, but I didn&rsquo;t find any results on GitHub, nor any discussions elsewhere.</p>

            <p>While reading Marcus Aurelius&rsquo;s Meditations, I was struck by the consistent focus on a few central themes. It reminded me of the propaganda technique, &ldquo;What I say three times is true&rdquo;. Marcus repeated the same ideas over and over, drilling into himself the mindset he was trying to cultivate. It&rsquo;s a glimpse not only into the life of a great man, but a personal journey into the person he strove to be.</p>

            <p>My girlfriend&rsquo;s sister is taking her first programming course using an &ldquo;interactive&rdquo; online textbook (a Zybook) for school, and I offered to tutor her.
When she needs help, she usually sends me 3 pictures:
 The text of the problem statement, Her python code, and The error message (there is almost always an error message).  I then decipher what exactly the question is asking for, what the error message says, what her code is doing, and finally write up an explanation to help her understand all of it.</p>

            <p>Before this year I was always a vim guy. I used vim for almost everything except JVM programming (Java, Scala. For those tasks I really prefer IntelliJ), but this year I installed emacs. I figured if I really wanted to participate in the holy flame war I better spend some time learning the other tool as well. I used a few different tool for all my electronic tasks, and here&rsquo;s what that landscape looked like for me before emacs:</p>
