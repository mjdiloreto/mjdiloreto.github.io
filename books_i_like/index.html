    <h2 id="what-am-i-reading">What am I Reading?</h2>
<h3 id="thomas-jefferson-a-strange-case-of-mistaken-identity-alf-j-dot-mapp-jr-dot-1978"><em>Thomas Jefferson: A Strange Case of Mistaken Identity</em> - Alf J. Mapp, Jr. 1978</h3>
<p>I picked this book up at Goodwill recently, mostly because a friend of mine has been repeating polemics and character attacks against the 3rd president that seemed off-base and uninformed to me. So I figured I would get informed.</p>
<p>There was a sticker on it which read <code>03/14/05</code>. Apparently it had waited 17 years for me.</p>
<p>So far I&rsquo;m thoroughly enjoying the style of prose the author uses, which is reminiscent of the rhythmic writing of Jefferson himself.</p>
<h3 id="the-sound-and-the-fury-william-faulkner-dot-1929"><em>The Sound and the Fury</em> - William Faulkner. 1929</h3>
<p>I picked this up at an estate sale along with four other old-looking hardcovers for $15:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>The Apocrypha</em> (King James Version). 1611</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The Life of Greece</em> - Will Durant. 1939</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The World&rsquo;s Great Thinkers; Man and Spirit - The Speculative Philosophers</em> - 1947</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The World&rsquo;s Great Thinkers; Man and State - The Political Philosophers</em> - 1947</p>
<p>Whosever estate I had picked was obviously very well-read and a lover of history.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-have-i-finished-recently">What Have I Finished Recently?</h2>
<h3 id="the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition-david-thomas-and-andrew-hunt-dot-2019"><em>The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition</em> - David Thomas &amp; Andrew Hunt. 2019</h3>
<p>I just recently finished this book. It has a lot of good advice - mostly what I would call &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; - but maybe I only find it common because I had good professors and mentors who taught me all those lessons early in my career.</p>
<h3 id="the-passionate-programmer-chad-fowler-dot-2009"><em>The Passionate Programmer</em> - Chad Fowler. 2009</h3>
<p>This was recommended online as a spiritual successor to <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em>, so I figured it was worth a read. Honestly, I wasn&rsquo;t a fan. It reiterated a lot of the common sense from <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em>, but where it diverged was mainly a lot of corporate boot-licking and self-congratulation on the author&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p>I did enjoy the dozen or so short essays from other authors that were sprinkled between the chapters.</p>
<h3 id="deep-work-cal-newport-dot-2016"><em>Deep Work</em> - Cal Newport. 2016</h3>
<p>This was a fantastic read. I often struggled (especially during the initial work-from-home phase of the pandemic), to get into the <em>flow</em> of work everyday. This book revealed what I already knew, but didn&rsquo;t put into such plain terms. My problem was <em>distraction</em>.</p>
<p>This book resonated with me to such an extent that I implemented the scheduling practice Newport proposes as <a href="https://github.com/mjdiloreto/simsched">an emacs lisp package</a>.</p>
